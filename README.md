# Maternal-Risk-Prediction-for-women-during-pregnancy

Pregnancy complications are caused by conditions before pregnancy or conditions that develop during pregnancy. The impact of pregnancy complications on maternal and neonatal outcomes is difficult to estimate because pregnancy complications are made of a wide range of conditions with varying levels of severity. Every year an estimate of about 3,58,000 maternal mortalities are recorded worldwide which is about 99% of cases from under developing countries. Early screening is expected to reduce maternal mortality rates. The purpose of this research is to analyze the risk factors associated and to also identify fit/final models with the capacity to predict maternal complications.

I have predicted based on the couple of Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA):

- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Cat Boost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- SGD Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Extra Tree Classifier
- XGB Classifier
- Voting Classifier

The variables in the dataframe depicts the below,

- Age is in years and calculated when a woman is pregnant.
- SystolicBP is the Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg [another significant attribute during pregnancy].
- DiastolicBP is the Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg [another significant attribute during pregnancy].
- BS-Level is Blood glucose levels of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
- HeartRate is the rate at which the heart beats in a minute.
- Risk Level is the Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attributes.

I have used interactive plot which cannot be displayed in the notebook and hence I have attached a pdf of the notebook for reference.
